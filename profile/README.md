# 🚻 Where2Go

**Where2Go** is a community-powered project on a mission to make finding a clean, reliable bathroom easier for everyone.

## 💡 What We’re Building

We believe everyone deserves access to restrooms that meet their needs — whether that means a spotless stall, a changing table for your toddler, a wheelchair-accessible entrance, or just peace of mind on a road trip.

Where2Go is a mobile-first platform that lets users:

- 🧼 Find public restrooms near them
- ⭐ Leave ratings and reviews based on real experiences
- 📸 Share images of bathroom conditions
- ♿ Filter bathrooms by features like accessibility or changing tables
- ❤️ Save and favorite go-to spots

Clean bathrooms shouldn’t be a gamble. With your help, we’re crowdsourcing the truth — one bathroom at a time.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

From families and travelers to commuters and caregivers, we all rely on public restrooms more than we realize. But until now, finding a restroom you can actually trust has been a matter of luck. Where2Go changes that by putting accurate, community-sourced info in your pocket.

Together, we're making public spaces more usable, inclusive, and dignified for everyone.

## 🙋‍♀️ Meet the Team

Where2Go was created by a small group of engineers, designers, and bathroom realists who were tired of rolling the dice on public restrooms. We’re building this in our spare time and growing it with purpose.
